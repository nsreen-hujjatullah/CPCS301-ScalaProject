# CPCS301-ScalaProject
Through this project, we will discuss the Scala programming language in all 
its details through that we can understand it more accurately. We'll start the research 
with an overview of when Scala began, for what reason its programmers developed it, 
its features, and where to use it. After that, we will study the implementation method 
used to develop Scala. For more, we will discuss the domain and fields in which Scala 
is used, examples of which are when designing web applications and most 
importantly, it is mainly used in big data processing.
We will also discuss topics that advance our knowledge of Scala such as BNF 
and EBNF identifiers, variable declarations, expressions, select statements, and loops 
that the compiler uses to evaluate developed programs. To evaluate Scala, we will 
study three main criteria: readability, writability, and reliability, and we will discuss 
in detail all the properties that affect each of these criteria. Of course, we will not 
forget by defining the types of variables that Scala provides, then the types of arrays 
available in Scala, and finally, we will finish our research by defining the types of 
scopes used in Scala.
